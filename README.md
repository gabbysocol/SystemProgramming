Repo contains Linux system programming tasks made in course of OSaSP

* :earth_africa: __BashProgramming__  
Write a script that finds all files of a given size in the specified directory and all its subdirectories. The range (min.-max.) File sizes - the first and second command line argument. The script displays the search results in a file (the third command line argument) in the form: full path, file name, its size. The total number of files scanned is displayed on the console. 

* :earth_africa: __WorkWithFilesAndDirectories__  
Write a program that finds all files of a given size in a given directory and all its subdirectories. The directory name is set by the user as the first command line argument. The range from N1 to N2 is the command line arguments. The program displays the search results in a file (the fourth command line argument) in the form of a full path, file name, its size. The total number of files scanned is displayed on the console.

* :earth_africa: __WorkWithProcesses__  
Write a program for counting the frequency of occurring characters in the files specified directory of its subdirectories. The directory name is the first argument. The main process opens the directories and starts for each directory file and a separate process of counting the number of characters. Each process displays its own pid, the full path to the file, the total number of bytes scanned and the frequencies of the characters encountered (all in one line). The number of simultaneously running processes should not exceed N (second argument).

* :earth_africa: __WorkWithSignals__  
	*_The tree of process_
	*_The signal exchange sequence_

* :earth_africa: __Work with threads__  
The user specifies the name of the directory. The main process opens the directories and starts for each directory file and a separate stream of counting the frequency of occurring characters.
Output: id of thread, full path, size, symbol, frequency.
The number of simultaneously running threads N

:exclamation: P.S. : formatted output, error output through the standard error stream (stderro)
